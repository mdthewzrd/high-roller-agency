# BMad Method™ WebApp Builder System

## 🎭 System Overview
This Claude Code project is a **specialized web app builder system** using the BMad Method with parallel specialist agents. You can instantly transform Claude into expert developers, architects, and strategists who work together to build modern web applications.

## 🚀 Quick Start - Transform Claude Now!

Type any of these commands to instantly transform Claude into a specialist:

```bash
/help                # Show all available commands and agents
/webapp-maestro      # Transform into WebApp Expert (recommended start!)
/pm                  # Transform into Product Manager 
/architect           # Transform into Solution Architect
/dev                 # Transform into Full Stack Developer
/parallel-workflow   # Start coordinated multi-agent workflow
```

## 🎯 How This Works

### Agent Transformation
When you type a command like `/webapp-maestro`, Claude completely transforms into that specialist with:
- **Deep domain expertise** in their specific area
- **Unique personality** and communication style
- **Specialized commands** for their domain
- **Clean context window** (200k tokens) for deep work

### Example Usage
```bash
You: /webapp-maestro
Claude: [Transforms into WebApp Maestro - expert in modern web development]

You: I need to build a SaaS dashboard
WebApp Maestro: I'll help you build a modern SaaS dashboard using the optimal tech stack...
[Provides expert guidance, architecture, and implementation strategies]
```

## 👥 Available Specialist Agents

### Primary Team
| Command | Agent | Expertise |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| `/help` | BMad Orchestrator | Master coordinator for all agents |
| `/webapp-maestro` | WebApp Maestro | Expert web app specialist with modern stack |
| `/pm` | Product Manager | Creates PRDs and requirements |
| `/architect` | Solution Architect | System design and architecture |
| `/dev` | Full Stack Developer | Code implementation |

### Specialist Team (8 Parallel Agents)
- **UI Designer** - Mobile-first UI/UX design
- **Component Architect** - React/TypeScript components
- **Performance Optimizer** - Core Web Vitals
- **API Architect** - Backend API design
- **Database Designer** - Real-time database (Convex)
- **Auth Specialist** - Authentication & billing (Clerk)
- **Deployment Expert** - Infrastructure (Vercel)
- **Monetization Strategist** - Revenue optimization

## 💡 Parallel Workflows

Multiple specialists can work simultaneously on different aspects:

```bash
/parallel-workflow "Build a SaaS application"
```

This triggers:
1. **Planning Phase**: PM + Architect create requirements
2. **Design Phase**: UI, Database, API specialists work in parallel
3. **Implementation Phase**: Component, Auth, Performance specialists
4. **Deployment Phase**: Infrastructure and monetization setup

## 🛠️ Recommended Tech Stack

The system advocates for the "lazy capitalist" stack for rapid development:

### Frontend
- **Next.js 14+** with App Router
- **TypeScript** (strict mode)
- **Tailwind CSS** + **Shadcn/UI**
- **Mobile-first responsive**

### Backend & Data
- **Convex** - Real-time database
- **Clerk** - Auth + billing unified
- **Next.js API Routes**

### Deployment
- **Vercel** - Zero-config deployment
- **Edge Functions** - Global performance
- **Vercel Analytics** - Monitoring

## 📋 Typical Development Workflow

### Step 1: Product Planning
```bash
/pm                    # Transform into Product Manager
*create-prd           # Create Product Requirements Document
*define-mvp           # Define minimum viable product
```

### Step 2: Architecture Design
```bash
/architect            # Transform into Solution Architect
*design-system        # Create system architecture
*select-stack         # Choose optimal tech stack
```

### Step 3: Expert Guidance
```bash
/webapp-maestro       # Transform into WebApp Expert
*recommend-stack      # Get tech stack recommendations
*design-architecture  # Create detailed architecture
*plan-monetization    # Design revenue strategy
```

### Step 4: Implementation
```bash
/dev                  # Transform into Developer
*implement-story      # Code the features
*create-component     # Build UI components
*setup-api           # Create API endpoints
```

### Step 5: Parallel Specialist Work
```bash
/parallel-workflow    # Coordinate multiple specialists
# Specialists work simultaneously on:
# - UI/UX Design
# - Database Schema
# - API Architecture
# - Authentication
# - Performance Optimization
```
